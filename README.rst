========================================
Experimental Leaflet.js based DZI viewer
========================================

Background
----------

We have a large number of images using the `Deep Zoom Image
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom>`_ format. Unfortunately, the 
`opensource release by Microsoft <http://openseadragon.codeplex.com/>`_ has not
been well maintained and the brunt of the modernization has been performed by
a single colleague (see https://github.com/thatcher/openseadragon) 

This repository is an experiment using `Leaflet.js <http://www.leafletjs.com>`_
to load the existing DZI image tiles as part of a possible migration strategy to
a project with more momentum and which I'm currently evaluating for related
mapping projects as well.
